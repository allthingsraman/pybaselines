===================
Pinned Requirements
===================

The requirements in this folder are pinned to specific versions to allow recreating
a specific build. This is useful in cases such as building documentation on readthedocs
or for debugging since this specific build is known to work on both Windows and Linux
with python 3.12.

If you only want to install all of the development dependencies for pybaselines, it is
recommended to instead use:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install pybaselines[dev]

or clone the repository by following the
`installation guide <https://pybaselines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#setting-up-development-environment>`_
in the documentation.
